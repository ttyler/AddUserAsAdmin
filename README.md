# AsUserAsAdmin
OneUser OneMac

As the name suggests, during login use the $3 parameter as a value to add to the "Admin group" on the local mac, howevere if there is another AD user already there, ignore this account and leave them as a standard user.

This is deigned for one user to be an administrator or their computer while subsequent users simply remain as non admins.
